## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to gather user preferences using a fun game and to chart those so that data may affect which products are offered in the Bus Mall Catalog

## How it Works

- On site load the user is presented with 3 photos of products and asked to pick their favorite
- When the user has clicked their favorite, another 3 photos will populate
- This cycle runs for 15 rounds and then the user can choose to `See Totals` by clicking a button
- When the user clicks the button a Bar Chart appears with their preferences
- The user is then given a button to `Reset` the survey and they can choose again or allow another user to choose
- The Bar Chart data will aggregate the data over the course of the survey until the page is refreshed
